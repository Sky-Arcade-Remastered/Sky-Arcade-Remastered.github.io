    <h3 style="font-size: 40px">
      Sky Arcade: Remastered is the predecessor to Sky Arcade. Sky Arcade was a website made by a group of four people in early 2021
      that eventually fell into ruins as the group disbanded and the website was in disuse. Recently though, two of the four original members
      decided to create Sky Arcade: Remastered and attempt to build on the foundation that was set. The goal of Sky Arcade: Remastered is to not only
      replace the original Sky Arcade, but to make it even better and funner for students during their free time.
